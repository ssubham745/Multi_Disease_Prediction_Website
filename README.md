# 🏥 Multi-Disease Prediction Web Application using Machine Learning

This project is a **Machine Learning–based web application** that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases using user-provided medical parameters.  
Currently, the system supports prediction for:

- 🩸 **Diabetes**
- 🧠 **Parkinson’s Disease**
- ❤️ **Heart Disease**

The application is built using **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for real-time disease prediction.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts **multiple diseases in a single platform**
- Interactive and intuitive **Streamlit web interface**
- Real-time prediction based on user input
- Separate ML models optimized for each disease
- Easy to deploy and extend

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

| Disease | Algorithm |
|-------|----------|
| Diabetes | Support Vector Machine (SVM) |
| Parkinson’s Disease | Support Vector Machine (SVM) |
| Heart Disease | Logistic Regression |
